# **What I Do When Waiting for a _Delivery ._**
### First thing I do is organize my thoughts and ask myself Questions.

List:
- What do I want to Create ?
- How do I want It to look ?
- What will be The main theme?

#### These are some Questions, but the Main thing is to organize all the different thoughts battling my mind.

# _To start I will explain: Who am I?_

To put it simply. I am a 57 years old, who has four children (all out on their own). My husband passed a few years ago.
I work for doordash and grubhub delivering with the hopes to one day get a remote job and travel while I work. 

Technology has fascinated me for many years. I remember getting my first Color T.V. when I was 8. The lrst cordless phone, beepers and then the first cell phones ( you must be rich to own one of those, LOL ). The TRS 80 that Played a Gargoyle game that only played in dos. After I had kids - Dial up Internet was a problem with four kids all wanting to use it with only one desktop computer to share. 
Through the years I have tried to keep up. First learning a little HTML and CSS code to make my own website. Then getting intrigued with python. I wrote my first code in a text editor and then a compilier. Today I see Something interesting and will go learn it. Like this post. I'm using markdown and github pages for this to learn how to use it.

I am now sitting uptown in my car writing this on my tablet with a Stylis pen in markdown code while waiting for a delivery from either doordash or grubhub. No orders yet, but to be fair, I knew it was too early. If I would have started this at home, I wouldn't have come to work at all today. This is more fun than delivering.

## _Organize Thoughts:_
List:
- To start setting up github pages.
    - 1.  Create New Repository with name: 'Learn on the Go'
                  - Done
    - 2.   Add this Markdown code to repository,
    (Yay, got a doordash order)
                   - Done
    - 3.  Go to Setting, github pages and set up.
                   ..* The issue starts: no GH-pages In Settings, so I looked on the left side and pushed GH-Pages which opened in another branch and needs an index.md file to run website. no problem I can Copy and paste into that file.
                    ..* My Website name is: 
                    ..* annewhit.github.io/Learn-on-the-Go/
    - 4.  See how it looks.
                    ..1. Played with the * asterisk for bold and the _underscore for italics. Also, the #for the size of text. Let's try the strikethrough.     ~~strike this~~    ðŸ˜† 
                    ..2. Trying ordered sub-list. Two dots and a number.
â€¢â€¢â€¢Just seeing what three dots before a paragraph will do to a paragraph.â€¢â€¢

...Just seeing what three dots before a paragraph will do to a paragraph...

    - 5.  OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again.
- See if the -symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
+ See if the +symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
* See if the *symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
..* See if the ..*symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
..1. See if the ..1.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
..2. See if the ..2.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.

...I am know testing to see if three periods before a sentence will make the paragraph print Correctly on the Page with the correct indents. 
â€¢â€¢â€¢I am know testing to see if three bullets before a sentence will make the paragraph print Correctly on the Page with the correct indents.   
   OMGoodness, so Maybe I should read the directions More carefully. The periods actually mean spaces.  
   And two at the end mean a line break.
   Can be Very frustrating. But also very rewarding when you finally figure it out.

   Did you notice that #5 went into a code block. That was unintentional. I had to do a little research to figure out what I did to make that happen. Seems if you put 4 spaces it automatically goes into a code block, LOL. The correct way to create it is to use 3 back-ticks. First let's redue What I was trying to accomplish last time.

- 5.  OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again.
- See if the -symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
+ See if the +symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
* See if the *symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
..* See if the ..*symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
..1. See if the ..1.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
..2. See if the ..2.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.

Conclusion:  Not quite What I was looking for.  I do see that the ' - + * ' completes the seperation that I was going for. But not the indenting.  I will try it again with some spaces. Brought them in 10 spaces, not 4, lol.

- 5.  OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again.
          - See if the -symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
          + See if the +symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
           * See if the *symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.

   Did not do what I Wanted. I will try again with the signs to the left with spaces to try to bring them over where I want them.  
- 5.  OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again.
-              See if the -symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
+             See if the +symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
*             See if the *symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.

   OK, well good enough Time to move on.  

- 6. *Block of code*
```python 
a = 5
b = 2
c = a * b
print(c)
```
   This worked well. You use 3 back-ticks, Then specify the Language, next line write your Code and 3 more back-ticks. I love Something that works the first time, ðŸ˜Œ.   

# *Update on _LIFE_*

   My delivering on the first day I started this went better than I thought it was going to.  Five hours $90, with 1 1/2 hours spent working or this github page. Today is the second day, Monday, I went to work for four hours and made $78. know I'm at home working on this page.  
   Probably Won't be back for a few days, need to take my dad for bloodwork tomorrow and get oil Changed, then work.  
   Make sure you check back in and see the updates. I still have a lot more to Learn in Markdown.  
   It was intentional not fixing all the mistakes. I want people to realize that we all go through a learning phase that sometimes isn't too pretty.  
   The more we try, the more we learn.  
   Have A Blessed Day.
