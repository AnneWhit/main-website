        <h2>If you want the actual Markdown Code for this post. <a href="markdown_post_site/post_one.html">Click here</a> You can copy and paste into Visual Studio code then save it and preview. I really liked Markdown and pretty easy to use, but I had problems getting to work as a a webpage.</h2>

        <h2><u>What I Do When Waiting for a Delivery .</u></h2>
        <p>First thing I do is organize my thoughts and ask myself Questions. These are some Questions, but the Main thing is to organize all the different thoughts battling my mind.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do I want to Create?</li>
            <li>How do I want It to look?</li>
            <li>What will be The main theme?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>To start I will explain: Who am I?</u></h2>
        <p>To put it simply. I am a 57 years old, who has four children (all out on their own). My husband passed a few years ago. I work for doordash and grubhub delivering with the hopes to one day get a remote job and travel while I work.</p>
        <p>Technology has fascinated me for many years. I remember getting my first Color T.V. when I was 8. The lrst cordless phone, beepers and then the first cell phones ( you must be rich to own one of those, LOL ). The TRS 80 that Played a Gargoyle game that only played in dos. After I had kids - Dial up Internet was a problem with four kids all wanting to use it with only one desktop computer to share. Through the years I have tried to keep up. First learning a little HTML and CSS code to make my own website. Then getting intrigued with python. I wrote my first code in a text editor and then a compilier. Today I see Something interesting and will go learn it. Like this post. I'm using markdown and github pages for this to learn how to use it.</p>
        <p>I am now sitting uptown in my car writing this on my tablet with a Stylis pen in markdown code while waiting for a delivery from either doordash or grubhub. No orders yet, but to be fair, I knew it was too early. If I would have started this at home, I wouldn't have come to work at all today. This is more fun than delivering.</p>
        <h2><u><i>Organize Thoughs</i></u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To start setting up github pages.
                <li>1. Create new repository with name: 'Learn on the Go'</li>
                <li>2. Add this Markdown code to repository. (yay, got a doordash order)</li>
                <li>3. Go to settings, github pages and set up. So the issues starts: no gh-pages in settings, so I looked on the left side and pushed gh-pages which opened in another branch and needs an index.md file to run website. No problem I can copy and paste into that file. My website name is: <i>annewhit.github.io/Learn-on-the-Go/</i></li>
                <li>4. See how it looks.
                    <li>a. Played with the * for bold and the _ for italics. Also, the # for the size of text. Let's try the strikethrough. </li>
                    <li>b. Trying ordered sub-list. Two dots and a number.</li>
                    <li>c. ...Just seeing what three dots before a paragraph will do to a paragraph...

                        - 5.  OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again.</li>
                </li>
                <li>5. Ok, so non of that worked. Let's try again.
                    <p>See if the -symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
                        See if the +symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
                        See if the symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. .. See if the ..*symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. ..1. See if the ..1.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. ..2. See if the ..2.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.</p>
                    <p>...I am know testing to see if three periods before a sentence will make the paragraph print Correctly on the Page with the correct indents. â€¢â€¢â€¢I am know testing to see if three bullets before a sentence will make the paragraph print Correctly on the Page with the correct indents.</p>
                    <p>OMGoodness, so Maybe I should read the directions More carefully. The periods actually mean spaces.</p>
                    <p>And two at the end mean a line break. Can be Very frustrating. But also very rewarding when you finally figure it out.</p>
                    <p>Did you notice that #5 went into a code block. That was unintentional. I had to do a little research to figure out what I did to make that happen. Seems if you put 4 spaces it automatically goes into a code block, LOL. The correct way to create it is to use 3 back-ticks. First let's redue What I was trying to accomplish last time.</p>
                    <p>OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again.
                        See if the -symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
                        See if the +symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
                        See if the symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. .. See if the ..*symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. ..1. See if the ..1.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. ..2. See if the ..2.symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion: Not quite What I was looking for. I do see that the ' - + * ' completes the seperation that I was going for. But not the indenting. I will try it again with some spaces. Brought them in 10 spaces, not 4, lol.

                        OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again. - See if the -symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. + See if the +symbol will Create a bullet with no indent. * See if the *symbol will Create a bullet with no indent.
                        Did not do what I Wanted. I will try again with the signs to the left with spaces to try to bring them over where I want them.
                        
                        OK, so non of that worked. Let's try again.

                        OK, well good enough Time to move on.</p>

            <li><u><i><b>Block of code</b></i></u></li>
                <pre><code>a = 6</code></pre>                      
                <pre><code>b = 3</code></pre>                      
                <pre><code>c = a*b</code></pre>                      
                <pre><code>print(c)</code></pre>                      
                       
            </li>
            <p>This code block was much easier in Markdown than html.</p>
            <p>This worked well. You use 3 back-ticks, Then specify the Language, next line write your Code and 3 more back-ticks. I love Something that works the first time, ðŸ˜Œ.</p>
 
            <h2><u><i><b>Update on LIFE</b></i></u></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>My delivering on the first day I started this went better than I thought it was going to. Five hours $90, with 1 1/2 hours spent working or this github page. Today is the second day, Monday, I went to work for four hours and made $78. know I'm at home working on this page.
                Probably Won't be back for a few days, need to take my dad for bloodwork tomorrow and get oil Changed, then work.
                Make sure you check back in and see the updates. I still have a lot more to Learn in Markdown.
                It was intentional not fixing all the mistakes. I want people to realize that we all go through a learning phase that sometimes isn't too pretty.
                The more we try, the more we learn.
                Have A Blessed Day.</p>
